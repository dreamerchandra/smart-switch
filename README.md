# smart-switch
This project is a home automation project which helps in controlling switches using ESP 8266 and arduino UNO. 

# configuration and setup
ESP 8266 uses active internet connection and firebase real time database needs to be configured along with this.
Firebase Auth credentials should be placed in Wifi.ino file
TX and RX should be connected between ESp and arduino. 
This file is tested with arduino UNO R and ESP 8266 however this would work with any modules.
An android app or webapp can be build along with this to control the switches.
